# quiz-js
 this is the module 4 project and we were assigned to create a quiz application to test our knowledge in javascript. the quiz contains 5 questions and has a starting time of 60 seconds. if the user answers the question correctly, they are rewarded with 10 seconds added to the timer. However, if answering incorrectly, the user is penalized by decreasing the timer by 10 seconds. Once finished, the user should be able to see their score and enter their initials to store the score on the leaderboard.
